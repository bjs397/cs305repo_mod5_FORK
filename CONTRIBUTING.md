## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Group8](https://github.com/NAU-OSS/Spring2023_Group8/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. Short descriptions of the commit are fine.

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit"

## Coding conventions

  * We indent using three spaces 
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * We use camel case rather than using underscores (i.e. variableName instead of variable_name).
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
