# DUMMY README FOR CS305 MODULE 5 

Spring2023_Group8 CS499 OSS

We are theoretically creating a framework to serve as a mod manager for a popular game. 
The manager theoretically will automatically extract mod files and apply them to the game files. 
The manager theoretically will also check the version of the game to the intended version of the mod to keep track of updates.
This manager theoretically will allow users to conveniently apply modifications created by others to their copies of the game.
